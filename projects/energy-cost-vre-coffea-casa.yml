shortdescription: Implementing energy consumption benchmarks on different analysis platforms and facilities
description: >
  Benchmarks for software energy consumption are starting to appear (see e.g. the [SCI
  score](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/blob/main/Software_Carbon_Intensity/Software_Carbon_Intensity_Specification.md#quantification-method))
  alongside more common performance benchmarks. In this project, we will pilot the implementation of selected software energy consumption benchmarks on two
  different facilities for user analysis:
     * the [Virtual Research Environment](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/contributions/11671/),
       a prototype analysis platform for the European Open Science Cloud.
     * [Coffea-casa](https://coffea-casa.readthedocs.io/), a prototype Analysis
       Facility (AF), which provides services for "low-latency columnar analysis."
  We will then test them with simple user software pipelines. The candidate will work in collaboration with another IRIS-HEP fellow investigating energy
  consumption benchmarks for ML algorithms, and alongside a team of students and interns working on the selection and implementation of the benchmarks.
